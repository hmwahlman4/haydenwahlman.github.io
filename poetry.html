        <h2>Poem 1: "The Moon's Embrace"</h2>
        <p>ballet class, being seven.
I still think of Miss Sandy’s voice giving a long, slow, beauuuuutiful at the release of a held position. How comforting it was to hear this kind of affirmation over your body sliding back into place, at exhale, even if you had the position wrong the whole time. To celebrate a return of natural give. It would fall over us like a quiet tide, a room of small girls taking deep breaths, hunched over the barre now letting their bodies succumb. And she gave us permission, in a kind voice and in grace. I’d smile big tucking back into fifth position, shoulders back, ballet fingers just so, the same way I smile now, allowing my limbs to hang soft after long strain, 
and telling them they’re beautiful in letting go.
When the world and ballet are congruent in rigidity and constraint, I think of beautiful draped over an exhaled sigh, that long, slow exaltation over a long-withstanding release. That a return of things is beauty, as well as strength and survival.

        <h2>Poem 2: "time"</h2>
        <p>time.
Slow,
slow,
slow.
That is how healing and answers come.
I would force them into a precipitous inertia if time were an animal I could wrangle with my hands;
if energy were their acquisition, I would be completely spent
instead of running for the sake of escapism.
I would like to believe that uncertainty and anguish are the exodus toward
(instead of the promise of)
wholeness and truth.
That they are a hunger to be rid of 
instead of the manna that sustains.
It is impossibly redundant for time to be such an avenue for healing and perspective
and yet
could there be another way to assuage the agony of patience?
If I am so quick to forget (as my humanity ensures),
let healing and answers take their time.
